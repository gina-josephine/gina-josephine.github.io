							<p> The Wørmhole is a VR website that can be also viewed as an interactive desktop website. It consists of two sections:</p>

							<p> The first is a virtual exhibition space where a different digital artist is showcased every month. This section was developed using A-frame, an open-source web framework for building VR experiences that allows developers to create 3D and WebVR scenes using HTML.</br></p>

							<p> The second is a platform of highly curated content, meant as a resource for creatives to refer to when learning and art directing. This platform is a fun introduction to new technologies, that requires no previous knowledge. It is divided into three categories: technologies, inspiration and resources. </br>
Technologies allow users to learn about different technologies at a beginner’s level and how they can be applied across industries. Inspiration is for art directors and creatives who want to outsource the creation of digital content. Finally, Resources — the most advanced category — is for those who want to develop or expand their practice. </p>
